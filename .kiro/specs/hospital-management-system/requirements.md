# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a comprehensive hospital management application that handles patient information, doctor appointments, hospital resource tracking, and analytics using Azure Synapse Analytics and Python. The system will provide operational management capabilities through a Python API backend while leveraging Azure Synapse for advanced analytics and reporting.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a hospital administrator, I want to manage patient registration and records, so that I can maintain accurate patient information and medical history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new patient visits the hospital THEN the system SHALL allow registration with personal details (name, DOB, gender, contact information)
2. WHEN patient information is updated THEN the system SHALL validate and store the changes with audit trail
3. WHEN searching for a patient THEN the system SHALL return patient records based on ID, name, or contact information
4. IF patient data contains sensitive information THEN the system SHALL encrypt and secure the data according to healthcare compliance standards

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a doctor, I want to manage my schedule and appointments, so that I can efficiently organize my patient consultations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a doctor sets their availability THEN the system SHALL store the schedule and make it available for appointment booking
2. WHEN an appointment is requested THEN the system SHALL check doctor availability and prevent double-booking
3. WHEN an appointment is created THEN the system SHALL assign a unique appointment ID and set status to 'Scheduled'
4. WHEN an appointment needs to be modified THEN the system SHALL allow status updates (Scheduled, Completed, Cancelled, No-Show)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a hospital staff member, I want to track hospital resources like rooms, equipment, and beds, so that I can optimize resource allocation and availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hospital resources are added to the system THEN the system SHALL store resource type, ID, and availability status
2. WHEN a resource is assigned to a patient THEN the system SHALL update the resource status and track the assignment
3. WHEN a resource becomes available THEN the system SHALL update the status to allow new assignments
4. WHEN querying resource availability THEN the system SHALL return current status and assignment information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a hospital administrator, I want to generate analytics and reports on hospital operations, so that I can make data-driven decisions about resource allocation and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN operational data is collected THEN the system SHALL transfer data to Azure Synapse Analytics for processing
2. WHEN analytics are requested THEN the system SHALL provide reports on doctor utilization, appointment trends, and resource usage
3. WHEN dashboard access is needed THEN the system SHALL integrate with Power BI for visual analytics
4. WHEN historical analysis is required THEN the system SHALL maintain data in Synapse for trend analysis and forecasting

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure secure access and data protection, so that patient information remains confidential and compliant with healthcare regulations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the system THEN the system SHALL authenticate users through Azure AD or JWT tokens
2. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
3. WHEN sensitive data is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt patient information and maintain audit logs
4. WHEN data access is requested THEN the system SHALL implement role-based access control (RBAC)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a scalable and maintainable system architecture, so that the application can handle growing hospital needs and integrate with existing systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API is deployed THEN the system SHALL use FastAPI framework for high-performance REST endpoints
2. WHEN data storage is needed THEN the system SHALL use Azure SQL for operational data and Azure Synapse for analytics
3. WHEN ETL processes are required THEN the system SHALL use Azure Data Factory or Synapse Pipelines for data movement
4. WHEN the system needs to scale THEN the system SHALL support deployment on Azure App Service or AKS
